This repository is a project taught by Khan Academy's HTML course.
It is available online, type the url yourself: kevinwijaya15.github.io.

Inside the website, you'll see one of the programs I have developed with JavaScript (Processing JS). 
Currently, I am only able to include one program, but more will come soon. Meanwhile, you can see my other projects by pressing the projects button on the navigation bar.

Also, on the footer of the website, I have included some of my social media links. Be sure to follow!
