        <p>
        
            A little bit about my professional life, I have been coding in JavaScript, C, and Python over the past few years. Throughout those years, I have developed websites, applications, and simulations.
            
            <br><br>
            
            Given the chance, I would love to learn more programming languages in the future.
            
            <br><br>
            
            That's all about me, myself, and I. Thanks for visiting my page, visitor!
